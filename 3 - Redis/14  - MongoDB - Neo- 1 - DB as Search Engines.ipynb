I was able to get it started okay but the first time I tried to make a call the screen went black and the call appeared to have not gone thru. I was just stuck with a black, blank screen. I didn't know what to do I just couldn't believe it! So, I pressed the on/off button a couple if tine and just shut the phone off completely to restart it. I was given no option to get back to the call, I didn't know what to do? Meanwhile, on the other end my call had gone thru! The person I was calling was on the other end saying.... hello, hello, hello, and wondering what was going on! Not cool when your calling your boss, not cool at all! This happened twice, and in my first two phone calls and that was enough for me. Because of the trouble I was having I set it aside for a couple of weeks and then decided I was just going to return it. But, I was unable to get it back within the 30 days so I decided I might as well keep it and try to work with it. Now I can't get it to work at all (it's been kind 4 months) because with the time passing and not using it I forgot my password! Of course I've been online doing little tricks to get past this and learn how to reboot it and start it from factory conditions and all that but nothing works! I have started the process successfully and it will look like its going to work but nothing ever works in the end. I just can't get any further with it. Now it's telling me I have to use my Google account i started with but when I try to put it in it doesn't take my information. So I am stuck in this perpetual mode of that blue screen and trying to get it activated and it's driving me mad! I've tried everything. Well, maybe not everything but the thing I am being asked to do to get thru the google lassoed, I have no idea how to go about and I'm just at my wits end with this. It's been over 4 months now and I haven't been as to get it to work almost the entire time. I will try to fix it again I suppose when I have the time and patience but wtf! This is such a pain. I've wasted so many hours on soo many hours nights trying to fix this and I still can't get the stupid thing to work! AT ALL! It just won't let me last this initial blue screen. I can't get past this stupid google account thing. Damn google! This is so frustrating! I have wasted my money and now my time trying to fix this and get this phone to work. It's been a nightmare. I wish I could just get my money back, I haven't even used it! But, they say no returns after 30 days. It doesn't make sense when they're selling a faulty product! And frankly it's not not fair and not right, nor is it fair or right on the part of Google either, I never asked to sign up with Google. I was forced to.\"}\n",

Hoping it was just a glich with this phone I called Amazon and they graciously sent me a replacement right away. Yet again, same issue . Finally went online to the Motorola community and saw many users were having the same problem with callers/yourself not being able to hear halfway through the conversation. Very embarrassing if you are on the phone with a business associate. I just ordered another ZTE Zmax 2 - so easy to use - incredible interface........very reliable.

This phone is truly pathetic in so many ways Im about to start a rant rather than a review. Short version: Don\\'t get this phone if you think the voice commands is what you\\'re gonna use. Don\\'t get this phone if you think you are gonna watch videos you take on the phone with you on PC or larger screens. Don\\'t get this phone if you use phone as a mass storage device. Don\\'t get this phone if you think Motorola\\'s 24/7 Live Chat knows this phone at all. Don\\'t get this phone if you think because you are paying a lot you are getting a lot. Don\\'t get this phone because it is a flagship model its gonna be good. Don\\'t get this phone if you think those 2 metal strips are BOTH stereo front facing speakers that sound good. Don\\'t get this phone if you got convinced by Motorola that they installed minimal bloatware as possible. Don\\'t get this phone if you think Wood and Metal is a good material to have on a phone. Don\\'t get this phone if you think the camera is gonna be any good. The rant: Well I was really hyped I saved up for an expensive phone to have one of them Flagship models in the market. Lot\\'s of good reviews here and there coming up. The more I read the specs the more I loved this phone without even having it! Kept reading each and every spec of the phone, on paper this is an IDEAL phone but this is the real world and it seems the engineers at Motorola they got a memo where it says \"Cut every corner you can, make this phone worth less than a brick\" because simply thats what you get for a phone at this price, a brick! The marriage- I walked in my phone service store, I was extremely excited about getting this phone. Wish I knew this was a gold-digger! As the salesman was activating my phone through the system I was in admiration and attempting every feature I knew about the phone. I tried the flick of the wrist to activate the camera, no it didn\\'t work. I tried voice commands OK Google, Hello Moto X, Hello Android... nothing. At least Motorola\\'s described minimalist was in the Lockscreen there, the lockscreen didn\\'t load wallpaper or anything just the Time and Lock logo everything else was a black screen. I was ok with that although I prefer an easy shortcut directly to Phone or Contacts. As he is putting in my SIM card, I give him my microSD card and he says it doesn\\'t have any. He then asks didn\\'t you read it in the specs? Heck I read the specs so many times it hurt my head but 1 thing is reading \"MicroSD is not supported\" in a spec sheet and another was my case where Motorola maliciously had the storage expandability HIDDEN so we don\\'t see the truth behind it. It looks better in a spec sheet no mention whatsoever of a microSD/expandability than a row of microSD: Not Supported, N/A, zip, nada, nuthing in the spec sheet doesn\\'t it? But I said well I got myself a 16 GB phone what would I possibly care about capacity!! All I need is 14GB so I did math I could eliminate 1 or 2 camera videos I shot and I would have 2 or 3 GB for my apps and multi media messages, right !? WRONG !! DEAD WRONG !! When I came home, connected it to Wi-Fi it started downloading upgrades, I went into the storage to set the USB options and DUM DUM DUM!! I couldn\\'t find it. Where are the USB options? And as I am looking through every menu in the Settings App I notice the available Storage... brand new phone nothing in it and it is 8 GB available ONLY!! On a 16GB brand new phone all the user gets is 8GB. This is downright false advertising, Motorola can say all they want that Android and pre-installed apps take space all they want but truth is this is the FIRST phone I have that doesn\\'t give me the space advertised. Even my cheap Coolpad Quattro II said 4GB and I have available 3.93 GB now THAT\\'s truthful advertising. On this 16GB phone that you pay more for, you get half, that\\'s right, 8 GB for you. Well 8 GB doesn\\'t sound so bad does it? Cant be that bad right? right!? Oh wait, there is NO expandability, no USB options and no microSD that means those 8GB get shared with all your contacts, multi media messages including sent videos and images through texts, anything that comes in through your bluetooth, preinstalled app updates (yes even those will continue murdering your storage) , cache and config settings, and THEN you get your space to put your things in like your own apps, your own videos, your documents, your pictures. All this is having a knife fight in your phone\\'s storage and guess what... there\\'s no rules! You always end up losing no matter what the phone always wins. Pre-installed apps take priority! The phone will make it so that space is NOT yours. Motorola claims they minimized the bloatware so the phone runs like your phone, not a turtle, yet there\\'s Mx Games app, Hangouts, Google+, 2 different music apps, 2 different image apps, 2 different mail apps, 2 different internet browsers, what part of having 2 of each is actually \"MINIMAL\" Motorola!? Lets start getting things in shall we? Plug in USB you get 2 options, as Media Device or as Camera. This phone will not connect as a Mass Storage Device. So if you plan on simply drag and drop a selection of files from your phone into your PC\\'s playlist to view in a large screen this is your first and last warning YOU CANT. You have to double click, this will forcefully make a copy in a temp folder on your PC of THAT file you wanted to open into your PC. Yes it will fill up your PC\\'s temp folder by simply trying to watch stuff from your phone on the PC. I was surprised that all the sudden everytime I ran the cleaner on my Antivirus the utility would clean up 6GB, heck once it got up to 21 GB and all this was the damn phone copying into a Windows temp folder everything I ever played on my PC from the phone. If you are ok with the phone doing this sort of thing and having to constantly wipe with a software that wipes temp folders then go ahead get this phone. How about creating playlists? Want them to play one after the other in a playlist? Nope! It has to first copy the file into the computer and then it adds 1 file at a time to the playlist. This is a \"Media Device\" remember? There\\'s no creating playlist or direct watching here, this is the first smartphone I have that has ever done that. Even my LG Spyder II as old as that thing was, knew that you should be able to play directly from the phone. Motorola thought of something new, wood and metal on a phone, gee on paper sounds so good having trust-worthy quality materials to protect your phone. This thing slips and slides and both the wood and the metal add the weight for the phone to just have a hard on for that floor. Every night of every day the phone is just aching to fall to the floor. It hasn\\'t happened yet, each time that slips is a constant reminder to place it exactly in the middle of any surface, but thats not enough! Even a tiny thud on a table will send it sliding to the edge. This phone was meant to fall. A 15 minute call will strangely tire my wrist too. What do you think of Motorola\\'s idea of having wood and metal on a phone now? Let\\'s play some media on the phone, it being a \"Media Device\" and all, it must sound pretty good with those 2 sweet speakers on the front. I wasn\\'t surprised cause I read the spec sheet was 1 speaker, so even if you see 2 Stereo speakers in the front you are actually getting one. Is it loud? Well loud enough. Is it clear? Hell no. The camera, lets try that now. Did it shoot? Yea, it actually did good after configuring the Moto Actions to work with the camera and it took OK pictures just not spectacular but I didnt buy an expensive phone for the camera now did I? Its the phone\\'s key features to Assist you, like it will auto-dim the screen when you are not looking at it. Doesn\\'t that sound so cool! It works to a mediocre degree and once it dims it doesnt brighten back when you focus again on it, it dims even if you are looking at it so I went to configure that in Moto app and it has a very neat app there which shows a face when the phone knows you are looking at it. So I tested it and failed more times than it worked. The face wasn\\'t showing when I was looking at it most of the time. Couple\\'s counseling -Now I called up on support so they would tell me what I need to do to get USB working as mass storage device, to clear up space and get a apps menu white background glitch solved. I was surprised they had 24/7 live chat support, but believe they arent any good in any sort of way if they dont know about the phone. I talked about USB mass storage device, I got a generic macro reply linking me to Motorola Device Manager so while it was installing I left that one at that and continued chatting about the other issues. Clearing up space, I got a generic reply linking on how to free up space which was clearing MY files off the phone basicly. Yes Motorola\\'s genius solution to making space is get your movies, pictures and music OFF your phone. Not the useless games pre-installed that I will never use or the redundant apps I got 2 of or the built-in Hindi Korean and Philip language packs support or the talk back accessibility, no, those have to stay... to eat your space and be useless. The break-up - I got this phone because the key selling point is its completely hands free Voice Commands. On paper its completely hands-free, you can just say the pass phrase then the command and its arguments and it will do as you say. One gigantic problem though, the mic sucks. You have to be no more than 3 inches away from the mic in a dead silent environment for it to recognize your commands. What\\'s weird is the phone will recognize humming so even if you don\\'t SAY the pass phrase but hum the right way it will wait for input. How about in a busy environment you may ask? Don\\'t expect it to work, ever. Funny thing is IF I plug in my Klipsch headphones which do have a better mic the voice commands work without problems so there is no denying that Motorola\\'s key feature was completely blown away by the mere fact that the mic is so cheap and sub-standard that a generic mic from a in-line remote on a headphone is better than the mic of a $550+ smart phone. People tell me I sound different through calls. Now tell me, if the KEY selling point of this phone is supposed to be the seamless Google voice integration with completely hands free voice commands would any of the smart people at Motorola bother to think they should invest an extra dollar on the bloody microphone? I guess there aren\\'t any smart people over at Motorola, they couldn\\'t even invest on the key selling point of a flagship model.'}\n",

Most of all the battery life is great. I can get two days out of a charge which I could not even get a full day from my Galaxy 7. The processing power is adequate and I don\\'t have sluggish apps etc. Overall the phone is meeting my expectations from a performance standpoint. The camera however, is a sad feature of this phone. It has trouble focusing, the image quality is not great, in fact, its not even very good. The lens stands proud on the back of the phone and ealy get covered in fingerprints. I\\'m constantly having to wipe it off because it won\\'t focus with fingerprint smudges. The fingerprint scanner on the front works better than my Samsung one did but not as good as iPhone does. It allows for registering multiple users and mulitipe fingers and that is a nice feature but I think that has more to do with Android than the hardware. The hardware though does recognize the fingerprint quickly and reliably. One, kinda creepy, thing is when you turn on the phone and the splash screen comes up a creepy womans voice says \"hello moto\", but she says it in a way that feels stalkerish. When I was doing the initial setup on it my wife was in the other room and kept hearing that when the phone restarted a few times and she hollered at me from the other room to stop doing that cause it was creeping her out.'}\n",

Also they tried to get me to update to a kyocera phone that felt flimsy and cheap chinesium junk for over 200! OK, I happen to be a very patient and stubborn. I got home and called the *228 to see if I could activate it. The operator told me that the ID was already in use. So I pulled the battery and behold the phone had a completely different set of FCCID and MEID. I called the activation go through the process again and get some nice lady.

I had a big problem with my iPhone 5c and especially its poor battery life. I be heard that samsungs are much better in this department and coupled with being water resistant and having a sd card slot it made me change the camps. I purchase the phone from a non prime seller who stated that the phone is new. The phone did arrive in the original box and appears to be new however it was not sealed in the original plastic. I was surprised that after a full charge the phone started draining battery in a worse way than my good old 5C. I admit that I spent about two hours setting it up and playing with the settings (gotta admit iOS is way more superior than this google business) and in 4 more hours tha battery was completely drained. So all in all 6 hours of use on a Abrams new phone. I jumped on Google to see if there is anything I can dos to improve battery life and of course found a bunch of advice on how to turn off this cut that and so on. However even with there's tweak the battery life did t improve at all. Perhaps this is a problem with the new generation samsungs but I don't want be inconvenienced with android and have a measly battery life at the same time. By Galaxy. Hello IPhone. Sorry\"}\n",

All I can say is WOW. The construction is solid, the phone feels and looks just solid. The power of Octa-core CPU combined with 6GB of RAM makes it run smooth. But this not what I love the most about it. Here are 3 things that made me love this phone, and make my friends and family seriously consider switching: - Battery life: I will wake up at 6:30 am, unplug the phone, NOT charge it the entire day, and at 11 pm it will still be at around 20 to 40%! Compare: Samsung S8 - needs to be plugged in by about 1 pm. - Camera: Leica lenses and real-time post-processing on the device - the pictures are stunning (especially open aperture mode which dynamically blurs the background for emphasis - wow. Even in the video mode! - No bloatware. This device carries as close to stock Android as you can get on a non-Google device. A few vendor apps of which most could be disabled. There ARE a few drawbacks, but not important for me: - no wireless charging: yes, would be nice to have - no 3mm jack: at some point, it will be a thing of the past - no micro-SD slot. THAT was the biggest disappointment. I had to retire my 256GB card. The phone has 128GB, which is plenty. So for me: bye bye Samsung - it has been a good run, hello HUAWEI. (Full disclosure: I bought this at a local B&H store, not at Amazon).'}\n",

I'm going to be looking at hardware,speed,and the battery life, so without further or do I'm about to hit you with a review. Hardware: The 2014 moto x is rocking an older Qualcomm® Snapdragon 801 processor (MSM8974-AC) with 2.5 GHz quad-core CPU, Adreno 330 @ 578 MHz GPU , and it honestly doesnt slow the phone down by much. With its beautiful display and dawn near stock android experience I feel As if it's definitely winning in the hardware section of this review. Speed: Honestly with the latest update the 2014 moto x runs extremely laggy for short bursts of time, I find myself having to restart the phone a lot more often. It isn't the fastest but it's well ahead of its competition. Battery Life: Okay it's not the biggest battery but it definitely lasts through the day, but at 100 percent brightness it struggles to make it from 8:00 am. to 5:00 pm. Now you definitely don't need it at full brightness ever, auto brightness is a huge battery saver. Yes it does get how when playing games like GTA:3, and asphalt 8. That was my written review if the 2014 moto x, I hope this post helped you out, show it some love by sharing it, and as always don't forget to join the tech side.\"}\n",

However, it still having a slight issue recognizing the SD card when you use the to combine them as one. Additionally, if you mount it as separate to save and transfer files, it is pretty much useless. I also tried several and card, and same error message, \" the external drive stop working. However, if you can live with that, it does feel like a high-end premium telephone in the market today for 300 percent more in price. The only reason I took one star off is that, unlike my other previous better-known brands, the bars inside my work building, Home Depot, etc, and other covered places were much stronger. This one tends to loose signal, and maybe because of the limited bands. It is sad when you must walk to an area near a door to make a call. In an emergency event that can become an issue. On my other well-known brands, I was able to make calls from say an elevator, office building with no issues, but with this one, the bars are gone, and often cuts in and out. I can live with because other brands sometimes have the same issues as I was told. Again, this phone is solid, but has less coverage bands to work with for a solid 4-5-Bars, and no LTE coverage, but the videos I have watched, and tested since, on WIFI, it works fast and solid. In sum: I believe that reviews should be based on your overall purpose of the phone. If you like to play games, do not buy a phone that is only good for texting regular basic to say hello, send a text or ignore your family and submit a review because your gaming experience sucks. Note: new update: Another issue I encountered on another model Redmi 5 Plus is that, Netflix is blocked on that model. I posted a question, and was sent a link, and it worked as i was told. Hopefully, that can be fixed by the company without creating a blog. Maybe because of the manufacture location your gaming experience'}\n",

I was excited for a phone created by the loved Android developer; however, after a year and 4 months, and 5 phones later the warranty is expired and this 5th phone now ALSO doesn\\'t work properly! The two stars are for the phone straight out of the box, it has some great features, I like the fingerprint in the back and the ok Google feature lights up the screen and helps me find my phone. The loss of the 3 stars is because after a few months the \"ok Google\" feature stopped working and I waited a while but eventually complained. This was in the first year and Google sent a refurbished phone (number 2) but the phone they sent had loose volume buttons and poor fingerprint sensor so they sent another refurbished (number 3) which I was a bit annoyed I had to get as they should check the phones before sending them out. This phone (still 3) had very obvious scratches and dents especially on the corners without damaged packaging so AGAIN I sent it back and they sent another. This one (number 4) ALSO had scratches although no dents but I felt it was unacceptable as the original one I sent I had taken very good care of and had no scratches. Finally they got it right... Or so I thought, and sent me a refurbished phone that appeared to be in good condition (number 5). This phone has worked great for about 5 months but now phone calls placed take between 1 and 5 minutes after being unresponsive to actually make the call as well as answering calls cannot be done from the pop up that says answer/decline I have to go to the main call screen and swipe up to answer and Google pretty much says I\\'m just shit out of luck because even though they never gave me a phone that worked properly for more than 5 months, it\\'s been too long from date of original purchase to replace. After trouble shooting it looks like nothing will work and I will have to live with this atroutiously flimsy calling feature until I can muster the hundreds of dollars I paid Google to get a new different phone.

Shatterproof (I drop my phone a lot) 2. Best camera on the market. (I take a lot of pics/videos) I was disappointed from the get go. It was very awkward to use... whenever someone would call, it would always be \"excuse me? What did you say? hello? Are you still there?\" I\\'d have to talk with the phone on speaker phone because not only was the call quality so poor the other person could never understand me, one wrong move and something would happen that would mute the call even though the mute button was untouched... it was weird. The only way to get through an entire call was to use the speaker. I went to Verizon and they said, \"oh that\\'s common.\" Common?? A phone you can\\'t talk on?? Never had that issue with my Note 4! The camera (which was suppose to be so great) had less features than my Note 4 had... (My note 4 had nice options for capturing details, and smoothing out the front facing camera for a less traumatizing selfie... etc.) This camera basically has a front camera flash which I prefer not to use because it always washes the picture out and causes awkward shading. It also blurs very easily and it takes forever to get the right pic, which sucks when the pic you want to take is in motion. My Samsung had a motion option for better action shots... and close ups gave better details. The back of my phone is kind of fabric like I guess... I was having an issue with my phone shutting off for no reason so I took off the phone protector case to see what the issue was... and I found mold... actual freaking mold. They said I probably got it wet and under the case it molded, but I\\'ve been very careful about this phone since it\\'s so new... it hasn\\'t been dropped in water, I do not take it into the bathroom during showers, I can\\'t think of anywhere it would have gotten wet enough to mold. Literally the next day after finding all of this and being told I got it moldy by getting it wet... the port is loose and the phone won\\'t charge unless I tilt it to the left then wrap the charger cord around it and stick it in my drawer upside down. I\\'ve tried other chargers, but it\\'s the port, not the charger itself. I\\'ve had nothing but crap since getting this phone. I should never have traded in my Note 4. the only reason I finally gave it up was because there were a few games that didn\\'t seem to work properly on it... but they worked fine on other phones. Worst mistake ever. I\\'m now looking to buy a Note 4 back. Sucks that I\\'ll continue to have to pay on this phone at the same time. but seriously it\\'s not even worth paying the $100 deductible on my insurance when I can get a refurbished Note 4 for that.'}\n",

Either way it\\'s fast enough to do accurate voice and handwriting recognition (in many languages) with no lag. It\\'s like having a quad core PC in your pocket. It\\'s loaded with 4.3 Android OS. It runs all the Android software out there like a jet. I loved it. No, there were no ear-buds with it. I put a slim case on it and was in new toy heaven. Until I discovered the face glass has a hairline crack across the lower right corner. I believe the glass was defective, but it\\'s really thin for its surface area, it\\'s bounded by a thin metal frame, no plastic bezel, so stress on the edge is stress on the glass. E.g. when removing the S-Pen you tend to press on the glass while pulling and lifting the pen, right where mine\\'s cracked. One way or another, this glass is just too fragile. I suspect the competition\\'s slightly heavier phablets use a better glass. Samsung could add a replaceable protector layer for pennies. This phone hasn\\'t done well in the face-down drop tests. In case of impact the glass is right \"there\" up front, and shatters very easily. The construction is super-light, yet the weight of the battery will drive it down pretty hard. Case or no case, the bigger the surface, the higher the odds of the face hitting something. In my case there was no drop, no impact, it was babied. Yet it\\'s cracked. Warranty? Forget it. I\\'d had it well under a week. The AT&T techs confirmed no sign of impact or abuse. But pls digest this essential factoid: AT&T says Samsung says the entire warranty is completely void if the screen is involved. HellO? THE most important and vulnerable part? One AT&T rep showed my son her own Samsung - with a cracked screen, and said \"I can\\'t afford to keep replacing it\". Mandatory: a very defensive case and (especially) the newest screen protectors. Other reviewers have documented its many positives. Agreed. But is a broken $750 phone with zilch warranty really worth more than 1 star to me? Go look at one. Look at YouTube clips of Note 2 repairs. Ask yourself if the Note 3 can survive two years of YOUR normal mobile use with the occasional drop. Can you live with warranties that are just as thin? The phablet is a great concept, but this is not the only one, and many more are coming. Unless you\\'re comfortable w/ re-buying (or re-building?) it, you might keep looking for a sturdier phone for daily use.'}\n",

Fingerprint integration works well and is very easy to set up during both initial-setup or later...just make sure to setup multiple fingers/thumbs for convenience (up to five)...or redundant prints for different conditions (humidity etc) as needed -- generally you shouldn\\'t _need_ to: are there \"phone-unlocking\" security concerns here....I do not know.

The gliding/swiping, long-press, and other opt-in features are fantastic (space-swiping, back-space swiping) but they do begin to experience some issues if the \"Key long press delay\" setting is set below 220ms. If you want those features to be super-reliable, try going higher -- it\\'s a convenience versus reliability trade-off that depends heavily on how- or how fast the user types and swipes. Some built-in sounds/ringtones are good, but most are not my type...They do work well on the built-in speaker. Some might complain that sounds can be too quiet, but it depends on the sound chosen, some are MUCH louder than others. I would classify most as \"hello-moto\" cutesy-tech types.

I purchased this phone for my wife. Her previous phone was a Microsoft Lumia 950, pushing 3 years of usage. This was a very good upgrade from that phone. The size difference was easily distinguishable and the first thing she noticed. The width is skinnier than the Lumia 950. The screen is also bigger, about an inch longer diagonally. She has small hands and it\\'s perfect for her to grip with one hand and use. She\\'s always used 2 hands for her smart phones so it\\'s still a habit for her to use two hands with this, but I see her using one hand more often than before. Next, after turning on and setting up the phone, the next noticeable thing was the amount of apps available. On the Lumia 950 she had to go through a website or just not participate due to lack of apps in the Windows store, but now that hasn\\'t been an issue. She\\'s been able to download a bunch of apps that have been very useful (for example, the Walmart app allows for Walmart Pay and she used the app to pay for a transaction in-store when she forgot her credit card at home). Last, she loves the camera and massive screen. She casually takes photographs but really enjoys the 21:9 aspect ratio for taking wide photos. She uploads to Instagram to show her family and friends back at her hometown and the quality of the photos that came from the Xperia 10 have been great. For me, I prefer something more mid-range (I have the Honor View 10 which IMO takes better quality photos and runs smoother) so I personally would rate this as \"good enough\" but for her, it greatly surpasses her basic needs and she loves the phone. Quick tip: she set up fingerprint unlock once for her thumb and it would misread her print a great deal, so I had her \"register\" another fingerprint when in actuality she just registered her thumb a second time and now it rarely misreads her fingerprint. Finally, a note about shipping: I preordered the phone on March 13 for my wife\\'s birthday present, it released on March 18, and was marked as shipped on March 20. A week went by with no shipping updates so I called Amazon support and the representative said that it was stuck at the warehouse, so she would send another phone rush delivery and when the original phone arrives to send it back. The second phone arrived on March 28, a few days after my wife\\'s birthday. I received the original phone in mid-April and sent it back. [EDIT] This phone gets one less star due to some apps just not working properly. I installed the McDonald\\'s app and Nike SNKRS app and both won\\'t properly connect, even though mine doesn\\'t have any problems. It could be because her Google account is originally from another country that is now being used in the United States but I don\\'t know. On her phone, the McDonald\\'s app won\\'t show daily deals and she cannot do mobile order, and the SNKRS app just keep saying there\\'s an error when trying to log in.'}\n",

I didn't like the iOS7 update at all, and I was already ready for a change of scenery. I needed a smartphone so my choices came down to an Android phone or a Windows Phone (since I had seen the trouble Blackberry had been having). Many of my friends have Android phones and they always complain about random things going wrong with it or just a laggy experience in general. Maybe there's an Android phone out there for me, but after talking to my friends, I decided to look elsewhere. When I started reading about Windows Phone, it seemed like many of the tech review sites were mostly negative. They'd say a few nice things about a Windows Phone, but then they'd go on to talk about how it doesn't stack up to iPhone and Android phones. In my experience using my new Lumia 928, I've gotta say I only find it lacking in battery life (which may be because I've been playing with it constantly since I've gotten it. I have a feeling I'll make it from sun up to sun down once the shine wears off a bit. Pros: Windows Phone interface is clean. The live tiles are a refreshing change of pace from the boring icons that I was used to on iOS. The camera is great on this phone. If you get this phone, make sure and use the Nokia Pro Camera app. I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I can get from this phone, and I was already pretty happy with the job the iPhone 4s did. This wins hands down. Fast. I don't know how they did it, but they made this system run very smoothly and with great speed. Apps load quickly on this phone and the transition animations don't feel like they are covering up lag like other phones I've used. Nokia Apps. Nokia did a really good job of creating apps that make this experience a great one. Nokia Pro Camera, Nokia Creative Studio, NOKIA MUSIC (HELLO!), Nokia Here Maps, Nokia Here City Lens, etc are really great, high quality apps that make this phone stand out over even other Windows phones. Cons: Learning Curve. If you've never had a smartphone before, I don't think the learning curve will be too bad. A lot of the interface is very intuitive. However, coming from iOS, I had to give myself a good 2 days of getting familiar with the phone before my head stopped spinning completely. :) It's just a different way of doing things, and I'm glad that I stuck with it. Battery life. I'm really hoping my battery will get me through to bed time once I start using it normally like I used my iPhone. I plan to get a wireless charger for my desk at work though just in case I get in a pinch. Apps. If you like Pinterest, you're not going to find it on this phone just yet (Sept. 2013). All of the apps I used on my iPhone are on my Lumia so I'm good on that. However, if you always want the newest app on the day it comes out, you'll need to stick with iOS or Android in some cases. Don't count the Windows Phone app selection out though. YOu really should look for yourself. Wrap Up: I'm sincerely delighted to have this phone in my possession. I never enjoyed the iPhone for the 14-15 months that I had it. Don't get me wrong. The phone did just about everything I wanted it to do. I just didn't enjoy it. Using this phone is a pleasure, and it's going to take something really special from another company to pull me away from Windows Phone. UPDATE: My issues with battery life are no more! I get through the whole day with the phone now with normal use. There's some juice left over at the end of the day, but I charge it every night so it'll be full for the following day. I stream music and videos a lot on my phone, and I use it constantly at work for email and calls, so I'm really pleased to see that I get through the day with it.\"}\n",

Not too small for my very nearsightedness, not too big to fatigue my arm as quickly as my Galaxy 3 8 inch tablet does. Big Pros: 1. Micro SD card slot can handle up to a 64GB card! 2. The back shell is removable - that's where the battery, SIM and MicroSD live. Allows for very sleek body styling. 3. Large, user replaceable battery. I'm old fashioned. I like a battery that I can replace if it gets where it no longer keeps a charge all day. 4. Humongous 6.3 inch gorgeous screen. Is it a tablet that makes phone calls ? Is it a phone that is also a wifi tablet ? Who cares ? It suits my needs and my wifes needs. 5. Price from Amazon locked on ATT carrier - I have been eyeballing this phone and a few others for a while. Was just given a new work phone, HTC One M7, it's pretty darned awesome, was considering that one also for our personal phones. ATT website had refurbed Mega 6.3's for Zero bucks, but they went out of stock befor emy payday. Started poking around the internet and found Amazon offering NEW 6.3's for a freaking penny! I'm not leaving ATT, and our 2 year contracts had expired, so Hello New Phones !!! 6. Amazon's freaking 2 day shipping was included in the already sweet deal for FREE! My wife and I are impatient. Two days is Amazawesome!!! 7. It's SO SHINY!!!!!!! Mmmm...Black and Chrome - reminds me of our black 2004 Mercury Marauder that we loved. 8. My wife LOVES her Mega 6.3. This is a woman that already owns a desktop pc, a netbook, a 17 inch laptop (for Sims 3, of course), Nintendo DS, two Xbox360s, and a Galaxy Note 3 8.0 inch tablet. She is NOT easily impressed. Oh yeah, she still has her two year old Acer 7 inch tablet, too. LOL Cons: 1. It's a bit slippery, make sure to order some kind of case at the same time is you can, even if it's just a cheap rubbery one to get you by while you decide on what type you will user permanently. I dropped the wife's Mega on the floor already (don't tell!). It didn't scratch or damage any part. This was a slide off some papers on the desk onto the hard faux wood composite floor. 2. I have to wait for this weekend to finish setting up and configuring our phones. :( But I got the numbers switched over to the Megas easily on the ATT web site. 3. It does not have Android KitKat yet, but is slated to later this year. 4. It took me a while to find and peel off all of the protective plastic on the shiny chrome metallic looking edges. 5. Took two whole days for the new phones to get to my house. STOP SLACKING, AMAZON !!! When I spend TWO WHOLE CENTS on my debit card, I WANT IT NOW!!! ( I do predict that Amazon will be the first corporate entity to perfect everyday use of teleportation. After that comes mind-reading...Amazon will know what I want before I want it due to predictive algorithms and will have it standing on the transporter platform waiting for me to authorize the purchase with my card. Really, Amazon, there is a mountain money to be made here.) 6. Seriously, I am having trouble finding serious cons here. The above cons are intended for your amusement only. I know these are heavily discounted due to a newer model on the horizon, but that's what I do. I generally buy a little behind the bleeding edge and save huge bucks while owning cool stuff. I've got a feeling that I am going to have to up our data plan some more. :-)\"}\n",

      "{'Ranking': 0.501187648456057, 'Review_ID': 'review_25723', 'review_body': 'I\\'ve not seen any reviews on this phone, at least on Amazon, from the \\'techie\\' point of view. I shall now make an effort to correct that. PROS: Excellent \\'heft\\' and feel, especially when snapped into an Otterbox \\'Defender\\' case (don\\'t bother with the \\'Commuter\\' series). Voice quality in phone calls is outstanding, with equally good screen quality and touch sensitivity. Very easy to unlock (the bootloader) and root! Kudos to Motorola for making the process relatively easy on those of us who want to experiment and customize. Please note, though, unlocking said bootloader will wipe any user data. If you\\'re going to do it, do it BEFORE you start installing your apps! I forgot about this and ended up having to reload everything. One caveat, one which cost the unit a star in the review, is lack of a US warranty. Motorola throws all sorts of loss-of-warranty warnings at you if you unlock the bootloader anyway, so I suppose this is simply the price one pays for wanting to be free of cell carrier lock-in and equally free to tweak things. I\\'m using this one on T-Mobile, and have had no problems whatsoever with coverage to date. I won\\'t be ready to try the dual-SIM trick until later this year, so I\\'ll post an update once I see how it works out. Another nice thing is you don\\'t get any kind of \\'Verifying your Account\\' notice when turning on the phone\\'s wireless hot-spot (Internet tethering) mode. If your account is set up for it with your carrier, it Just Works. CONS: First, the practical stuff. Supposedly a \\'non-removable\\' battery. If a battery which is easily user-replaceable, without special tools or skills, is important for you this is NOT the phone you want. If you\\'re a techie, this is not a big issue. On the topic of cases: Otterbox makes a great \\'Defender\\' series case for the Z2 Force, and it fits this phone (the Z2 Play) quite well. However, the use of any full wrap-around case will not permit the use of any of the MotoMods modules while the phone is so enclosed (unless the case is specifically designed for it, sacrificing a degree of protection along the way). The other caveat with the \\'Defender\\' case is it has no hole in the bottom edge for the Z2 Play\\'s earphone jack. This isn\\'t a problem for me, since I don\\'t use wired earpieces with mine, but it is something to watch for. If you want to use earpieces, and you go with the Defender case, you\\'ll need to (carefully) cut a hole in the case\\'s bottom section to allow jack access. Finally, cosmetics: The startup animation is horrendously ugly and obnoxious, right along with the syrupy-preppy \\'Hello Moto\\' voice clip. I will soon be replacing that technicolor abomination with something of my own design. They didn\\'t do any better with the stock sounds for ring tones and event notifications. Best advice I can give here is, bluntly, root the thing and tweak the blazes out of it (I copied the ringtones and notification sound set over from my old LG V20). CONCLUSION: This phone is not one I would consider to be right for everyone. I needed the dual-SIM capability, as well as broad compatibility with non-US (particularly Canadian) cell systems. I also wanted something that was root-and-mod friendly, reasonably rugged, with good battery life and, ideally, a user-replaceable battery. It also had to be compatible with my favorite protective case, and do a damn good job at Just Being A Phone. I couldn\\'t care less about video resolution (the screen looks great for my purposes and that\\'s all I ask), gaming capability, Facebook (Farcebook?), Twitter, Pokemon Go (off a cliff), or any of the other time-wasting, brain-sucking crap that seems to infest most \"smart\" phones these days. I have no clue how this particular phone performs in these areas, nor do I particularly want one. If that\\'s what interests you, please feel free to post your own review focusing on it. UPDATE, 3-Jul-18 ------------------------ I\\'ve finished putting the dual-SIM functionality to the test. I\\'m happy to report it works just great (Virign Mobile, aka Bell Canada), though it will take some getting used to. You can designate, on the fly, which SIM gets used for voice, data, etc., and you can also completely disable or re-enable a given SIM, also on the fly. The phone still loses one star for not having a battery that\\'s easily user-replaceable. Other than that, I couldn\\'t be more pleased.'}\n",

      "{'Ranking': 0.5009881422924901, 'Review_ID': 'review_82247', 'review_body': 'Last year I tried Samsung\\'s Ultimate Test Drive program, wherein they allowed iPhone users to borrow a Galaxy phone for 30 days. I tried a Note 5, and came away underwhelmed in a few areas- especially battery life. But recently, due to Apple\\'s shockingly poor iOS updates, which finally rendered my 6+ unusable (by my standards for a $900 device- constantly freezing screen, random reboots, apps not updating, Apple Music, device randomly not charging!?!?!), I made the big leap to Android. I looked at the HTC 10, the LG G5, and the Galaxy S7/S7 edge, and eventually, I landed on the S7. There are a few reasons for this: Size- The 6+, G5, HTC 10 and the edge are all similar in size, and too big for a jeans pocket. The S7 is far more manageable, even in a sturdy case. Specs- Apple makes a lot of claims about its devices being \"future-proof\", and everyone who has ever taken Apple at their word knows this is nonsense. Each major iOS update slows their devices down dramatically, so much so that I believe this is intentional; after all, Apple NEEDS us to buy phones every year. Without the iPhone, Apple is a much smaller, unprofitable company. At any rate, allowing 1gb of RAM on the 6+ was a mistake- especially with iOS 9. The S7, by contrast, has 4gb of RAM and a Snapdragon 820 processor. If this phone can\\'t last an entire year (a feat managed only by the 4s in my experience), I don\\'t know what will. I do find the device to be snappier when using Samsung\\'s own TouchWiz launcher, though. Battery- Overall, this is a compromise. The S7 has better battery life than the 6/6s, but worse than the 6+/6s+, due both to size and software optimization. But I got so sick of the 6+, which is so comically large in your hand and pants pocket that I was willing to take the hit on battery life. Camera- This is where Apple has slipped the most. Do the 6/6s phones have bad cameras? No- just lackluster cameras. I was underwhelmed by the 6s, especially when they increased the megapixel count without increasing the sensor size. (When they released the 6 and 6 Plus, Apple noted that they had increased the sensor size for the 6, while maintaining megapixel count, which allowed the sensor to have larger pixels, thereby gathering more light and decreasing noise. Just one year later, they did a bizarre 180 and started talking about how more megapixels= better pictures. Please.) The S7 takes phenomenal pictures with no tweaking. It won\\'t replace my DSLR, but it blows the 6+/6s+ away in detail and low-light, and it has Optical Image Stabilization- which the smaller 6/6s models lack, because Apple creates blatantly unnecessary product distinctions in order to upsell its customers. (16gb iPhone 6s Plus, I\\'m looking at you.) I recommend turning off \"Beauty Face\" for selfies, which yields weird, alien-like results, and my screen is set to \"Basic\" for accurate color reproduction, but otherwise, just point and shoot. The icing on the cake was the microSD storage, which I think can expand the memory by 200gb, thereby giving me more storage than the most spacious iPhone while saving me $300(!). The Samsung Galaxy S7 is not a perfect phone; Android is sometimes noticeably slower than iOS, and there is some lag here and there, but Samsung isn\\'t trying to sell me \"the best phone,\" or a lifestyle, for that matter- they\\'re just selling a really good smartphone, so I\\'m willing take the flaws in stride. There are fewer apps, but the ones I need (social, financial, photography, etc.) are all there. I will say, I never thought I would miss the iPhone keyboard, but I do. Go figure. Many of my issues with the Note 5 were addressed by Samsung with the S7/S7 Edge. I felt that the Note 5, while very light, felt kind of chintzy compared to an iPhone. The battery was an issue, and Samsung\\'s TouchWiz was bloated and annoying. I think the Test Drive Program was actually a brilliant market research initiative, allowing iPhone users to test Galaxy devices for free and providing feedback about their impressions and experience; I guarantee you that I\\'m not the only iOS user frustrated by the ever-shrinking batteries of supposedly state-of-the-art-devices, annual updates that damage or remove functionality while adding unwanted, sub-par subscription services, bloat and undeletable apps meant to sell you obsolete-before-they-were-released $700 watches AND the deliberate withholding of new software functions to get you to buy a new device. If you are sick of Apple\\'s pretentiousness, their walled garden or the \"Apple tax\", which seems to add about $300 (or more) to every product for no good reason (other than an aluminum unibody design, I guess?), give the S7 a try. I\\'m enjoying myself, most of all because I\\'ve got a phone made by a company that is actually listening to what customers want, rather than patronizing them and giving them what the company thinks they ought to want. Goodbye, iPhone. Hello, Android! Edit: Android 7.0 Nougat caused the S7 to become unreliable, and exacerbated some of the shortcomings well-known to affect Samsung phones. After about a year of ownership, I had to ditch the S7, and ended up with the LG G6.'}\n",

The N9000 is the European phone, and gets setup for the carrier used in the European country where you activate the phone. Period. US users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number. It\\'s that simple. Amazon makes both available. I teach overseas yearly. I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.] First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store. I am a writer though. Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster just reports the specs you already have. Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today. As for those phones that only show an app screen. I call them cave phones. 1. The beautiful 5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\" factor. Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI. Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks. Check it out for yourself. For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical? You bet. You get more viewable data for all social networking apps; you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps; you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it. I will never go back to a small screen phone. This phone is a joy to use. 2. The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time. It will perform well for years to come. A few other phones have it. No lag on this baby. Just try to do things to outpace it. It moves data faster than you can see. Partially because of #3. 3. The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it. Graphics are amazing. It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer. 4. It\\'s the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM. It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an SD card. Note: No extra charges for these! 5. It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED. Very few phones have this. It is also the only phone to do 4K video right now - sharp! It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great. 6. No other phone has USB 3.0. 2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable. File transfer times are faster. With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC. With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds. 7. How many phones have an S Pen? Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional, and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate. 8. How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery? It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen. Hardware CPU and GPU improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant. You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones. 9. It does infrared remote control. It also has TV-out (via MHL A/V link), Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor. I\\'m serious people, you get more for your money. 10. Hello multitasking! The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone. You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen. This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor. The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer. How many phones can do that? You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever. 11. This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period. The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen. Don\\'t believe me? Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself. 12. It doesn\\'t just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites. DL a GPS satellite app, and you\\'ll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location. 13. Got Knox? No, you don\\'t. This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi. You don\\'t have to use it, but it is there. 14. The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic. How many phones do that? 15. Is the screen too large for one handed operation? Yes, but so what? The tradeoff is worth it. Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. 16. I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider, wearing suit pants to jeans. Both phones fit fine in your pocket. Don\\'t worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans. 17. The TouchWiz UI is fine, and superfast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store. Over a million users. So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer. There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion. I don\\'t know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users. The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. I do like the new speaker placement though. Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user. However, there should be two of them or a better one. It is Ok, just not great like the rest of the phone. This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box. Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing. Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones. That means Samsung can do it too. Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof. It\\'s doable, so please do it. Smoke it with that nano-whatever waterproofing stuff. You went to CES. All that said, I\\'m very happy, with the Note 3. IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer. As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now. There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better, for the same flag-ship- phone price. I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don\\'t research the market. They pay top dollar but don\\'t get their money\\'s worth. Amazon is a great place to get your money\\'s worth and to find out user information. Thanks Amazon. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it\\'s a really good phone too. Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good screen protector.'}\n",

I contacted a rep via chat. Everything she told me to try was useless, so while she was typing I found a tutorial in some forum online that solved the problem. (I can\\'t remember what I did. Something about clearing a cache.) Anyway, I thought my problem was solved until error messages started popping up. Something about processes and various apps that had stopped working. No service was available at that point because it was New Year\\'s Day, so I tried to find a solution online. I tried all sorts of things--clearing caches, deleting apps, etc. Finally, I reset my phone to factory condition. Then when I turned it on it would get stuck on the Motorola screen and the battery would drain rapidly. On Jan 2, I chatted with a rep again and explained the situation. A couple hours later, I delivered the phone to FedEx to be shipped to Texas for repair. Jan 7 - Received email stating my phone arrived in their warehouse. Fast forward to Jan 14, still no phone. So I call... Rep #1 (heavy accent & hard to understand) - Tells me it\\'s going to be at least another week because they don\\'t have my phone in stock. I ask for clarification because my phone was supposed to be repaired, not replaced. What does he mean it\\'s not in stock? He gives a blah blah blah response, so I ask to talk to someone else. Rep #2 (even heavier accent & harder to understand) - Asks if I can be put on hold. I laugh and mention that it\\'s funny how I just got put on hold by first rep and now I immediately have to be put on hold again. So she tells me she won\\'t put me on hold. Instead she\\'ll lay her headset down so I can hear everything. What the? She comes back and tells me I have to wait another week for my phone but doesn\\'t know why. I question why the first rep said they\\'re waiting on a new phone. She\\'s confused and starts giving me a blah blah blah answer, so I ask to talk to someone else. Rep #3 - I explain to Kristine that I\\'m confused. What the heck is going on with my phone? Where is it? Why was I told they\\'re waiting for a new phone to come in? She puts me on hold. She comes back and tells me they are actually waiting on a part for my phone. So I question why they Motorola system isn\\'t set up so that anyone who has contact with a device is required to note it in the system. I mean, this company is in the business of connecting people in the blink of an eye. Don\\'t tell me they can\\'t set up a system where ALL employees who work on an account have the ability to share info related to the product. Kristine tells me that\\'s just not how it works. I proceed to spend at least 30 minutes on the phone with her questioning the ridiculousness of the situation. I find out that the first two reps are in the Philippines, Kristine is in Wisconsin, and my phone is in Texas. Annoying. Moving on...Kristine assures me that she will make contact with the warehouse to find out the exact status of my phone. When they expect the part, how long to fix, when I can expect my phone, etc. I get off the phone with her and receive the following email approximately five hours later: Hello XXXXX, Per our earlier phone conversation I am sending you an email as well. I reached out to our warehouse to inquire about an update on the repair of your 2nd Generation Moto X for Republic Wireless. I truly apologize about the delay and the incorrect information you have received. I am working to get your repair taken care of as quickly as possible. I appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. I received a response from my warehouse informing me why your repair has been delayed. We do not currently have the necessary parts needed to repair your device. We are waiting for a shipment of the necessary parts to complete the repair. I have inquired if it would be a possibility to replace your device with a certified like new device of the same model rather than to repair it. I am awaiting their response. If we have the ability to replace the phone quicker than it could be repaired would you be interested in pursuing that route instead? I have informed our warehouse that your case is urgent and needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. I understand this process has been extremely frustrating and I apologize that you have not been kept up to date with the status of your repair. I will provide you with any updates that I receive as soon as they are available. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me directly by responding to this email or by calling me at 866-861-8157. Please reference case number XXXXX-003395 when you call. I do want to let you know that I will be out of the office until Monday 1/18/2016. If you have any questions please feel free to email me and I will respond as soon as I return to the office. I hope you have a nice evening. Kind Regards, Kristin Motorola Customer Care Executive Customer Relations Department I didn\\'t view this email until Jan 15. As I was debating whether to wait for my phone or have them send me a certified like-new device, I get an email from FedEx at 8:27 a.m. notifying me that my device is on its way. Huh? What device? My device or a certified like-new device? I hadn\\'t responded to Kristine\\'s email yet, so how could a device already be on the way, not even 15 hours after she sent her email? So I call service for clarification. Rep #4 - Tells me the part for my phone was received, my phone was fixed, and now it\\'s on its way. All in less than 24 hours of me being told it would be another week. This makes no sense to me so I start asking questions. I ask her why she said a part came in and my phone was fixed and explain why that makes no sense to me. This rep back tracks and tells me she never said it was MY phone that was fixed. She tells me it was a different phone. Oh, so apparently they have a lot of broken phones laying around waiting for parts so that they can be fixed? I was getting nowhere with her, so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. She tells me she IS a supervisor. I ask to talk to her supervisor. Rep #5 - I ask what her title is. She tells me she\\'s a supervisor. *sigh* Moving on. I explain EVERYTHING, all the way back to the reps in the Philippines. This \"supervisor\" goes through her whole blah blah blah routine - I\\'m so sorry for all the confusion . . . people will need some coaching . . . I\\'m sorry but I can\\'t communicate directly with the warehouse . . . I don\\'t know why you were told that . . . I\\'m sorry, that person shouldn\\'t have said that . . . No, I can\\'t tell you what was wrong with your phone. (BECAUSE NO ONE WHO WORKS FOR THIS COMPANY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER!!! Why can\\'t they all just get Motorola phones?) Anyway, I finally get Rep #5 to admit that she\\'d be pissed if she\\'d gotten the runaround like me. She also describes everything she can see on her computer screen about my phone, which isn\\'t much. She deduces that when the warehouse got word from Kristine that my service needed to be expedited that they canceled the repair order and went ahead and sent me a certified USED phone. I asked rep #5 if there was any way she could find out what was wrong with my phone, maybe what part it needed. I\\'m just curious. I want to know what was wrong with it in case I have the same issue with the used one they\\'re sending me. She said she can\\'t do that because it\\'s against their policy. Whatever. And now, I just received this email, prompting me to report what happened: Dear XXXXX, We\\'ve shipped your repaired device back to you. We had to make extensive changes, but it\\'s now in good working condition. If you need any help or have questions, give us a call. We\\'re standing by at 800-734-5870 Monday - Friday from 7AM-10PM, Saturday - Sunday 9AM-6PM CT. You can also track the status of your repair here Motorola Tracking Number (RMA) – XXXXXX Motorola Service Program – Repair and Return FedEx Tracking Number – XXXXXXXX Best Regards, Your Moto Care Team Note - A robot sent this, so please DO NOT REPLY. Instead, use the contact information provided. WHAT THE {implied profanity}? \"We\\'ve shipped your repaired device back to you. We had to make extensive changes, but it\\'s now in good working condition.\" Seriously? So now they\\'re saying they DID repair MY device? I was extremely satisfied with this phone at first (and happy that I didn\\'t spent a fraction of the cost of an iPhone) and I had been telling people that it\\'s just a good as an iPhone. I guess I lied. I won\\'t be recommending Motorola devices to people anymore. Motorola either needs to make a better product that doesn\\'t crap out after 7 months of use, or they need to create a better, more efficient customer service system. This whole cluster is just RIDICULOUS! Bottom line: If you\\'re considering a Motorola phone, maybe consider what will happen if something goes wonky with it. The service is TERRIBLE. I have an iPad and several iPods. Whenever I\\'ve had to contact Apple, the service is extremely efficient.'}\n",

      "{'Ranking': 0.5005931198102017, 'Review_ID': 'review_70158', 'review_body': 'Forget those silly complaints about region lock. They do not affect USA carriers, or even 99.9% of other users. They do not apply to this US version. The region locked N9000 is not LTE and uses a different CPU; it is the European/ international version. It does have problems with switching SIMM cards between countries so no one should get it. (Bad move Samsung). US users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number. It\\'s that simple. Amazon makes many versions available. [I teach overseas yearly. I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.] First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store. I am a writer though. Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster just reports the specs you already have. Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today. As for those phones that only show an app screen. I call them cave phones. 1. The beautiful 5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\" factor. Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI. Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks. Check it out for yourself. For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical? You bet. You get more viewable data for all social networking apps; you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps; you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it. I will never go back to a small screen phone. This phone is a joy to use. 2. The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time. It will perform well for years to come. A few other phones have it. No lag on this baby. Just try to do things to outpace it. It moves data faster than you can see. Partially because of #3. 3. The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it. Graphics are amazing. It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer. 4. It\\'s the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM. It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an SD card. Note: No extra charges for these! 5. It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED. Very few phones have this. It is also the only phone to do 4K video right now - sharp! It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great. 6. No other phone has USB 3.0. 2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable. File transfer times are faster. With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC. With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds. 7. How many phones have an S Pen? Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional, and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate. 8. How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery? It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen. Hardware CPU and GPU improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant. You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones. 9. It does infrared remote control. It also has TV-out (via MHL A/V link), Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor. I\\'m serious people, you get more for your money. 10. Hello multitasking! The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone. You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen. This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor. The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer. How many phones can do that? You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever. 11. This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period. The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen. Don\\'t believe me? Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself. 12. It doesn\\'t just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites. DL a GPS satellite app, and you\\'ll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location. 13. Got Knox? No, you don\\'t. This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi. You don\\'t have to use it, but it is there. EDIT: It is there, but for some reason AT&T does not allow access this secure environment. Guess they want their competitors to get all those deserting Blackberry customers. 14. The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic. How many phones do that? 15. Is the screen too large for one handed operation? Yes, but so what? The tradeoff is worth it. Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. 16. I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider, wearing suit pants to jeans. Both phones fit fine in your pocket. Don\\'t worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans. 17. The TouchWiz UI is fine, and super fast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store. Over a million users. So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer. Neither is S-voice, which is still seriously lacking. Just use Google voice and DL a different sound from the app store if you want. There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion. I don\\'t know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users. The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. I do like the new speaker placement though. Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user. However, there should be a better one with more bass. It is Ok, and plenty loud, just not great like the rest of the phone. This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box. Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing. Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones. That means Samsung can do it too. Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof. It\\'s doable, so please do it. Smoke it with that nano-whatever waterproofing stuff. You went to CES. All that said, I\\'m very, very happy, with the Note 3. IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer. As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now. There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better, for the same flag-ship- phone price. I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don\\'t research the market. They pay top dollar but don\\'t get their money\\'s worth. Amazon is a great place to get your money\\'s worth and to find out user information. Thanks Amazon. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it\\'s a really good phone too. Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good screen protector.'}\n",

I skipped the Note 3 mostly because I didn\\'t have any available upgrades on my family plan ;-). Plus I figured I\\'d skip a generation and get a much better Note. I purchased the Note 4, thought it was great, and then promptly returned it. \"Why\", do you ask? The answer is simple... ================================================= THE DROID TURBO IS THE BEST PHONE KNOWN TO MAN! ================================================= Before you kill me for saying this, hear me out. I\\'m not a fan boy. I don\\'t work for Motorola. I\\'ve tried a number of the current flagship phones before deciding on the Turbo. Here are some of my thoughts on the other phones: - I tried the Note 4, thought it was great, and returned it. - I have the iPhone 6 Plus, loved it, planned to keep it, tried the Turbo, and now I\\'m looking to sell the 6 Plus. - I also owned the HTC ONE M8 for Windows, thought it was cool, was pleasantly surprised when it started reading text messages to me automatically while I was driving, but I returned it as I was worried about the ecosystem. - I briefly got my hands on the Nexus 6. Thought it was great. Was happy to see that it was made by Motorola, and was then quickly disappointed that it was missing the Motorola Apps and features found on the Moto X and Droid Turbo. In my opinion, the combination of great specs, a great screen, blistering performance, slap your momma long battery life, and most importantly, the unique suite of Moto Apps firmly places the Droid Turbo ahead of all other smartphones. ✔ PROS: - Very nice screen - Fast Performance - Good (not great) camera - Double twist your wrist to launch the camera - The mother of all batteries (MOAB) - Trusted Devices: Keep your phone unlocked when it\\'s near a trusted device (headset, fitness band, etc.) - Moto Voice: The Turbo is always listening for your commands, allowing you to use your phone without touching it - Moto Assist: The Turbo knows when you are home and allows you to accept/reject phone calls via verbal commands. When you are home or when you are driving, the Turbo allows you to hear and respond to text messages via verbal commands. The Turbo will also silence your phone during meetings - Moto Actions: Sensors detect hand gestures to let you activate your phone\\'s screen without touching it. You can use this to see the current time, preview notifications, or wave off incoming calls - Moto Display: See notifications on your phone without touching the phone. You can preview and act on notification from the lock screen - Customizable \"Hello Google\", hands free voice command phrase. - Accurate voice recognition courtesy of an included secondary chip dedicated to natural language processing - Qi wireless charging support. Just buy a $20 wireless charger and you\\'re set. - Turbo Charger support (get 8 hours of charge in only 15 minutes) - Very close to stock Android 4.4. In the past, Motorola has provided quick Android OS updates to its phones. - Cheaper than a Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus (sans incentives, trade-in offers, etc.) - Solid, sturdy build. There won\\'t be an iPhone 6 Plus type \"Bend-Gate\" for the Turbo. ✔ CONS: - You won\\'t get the advertised 48 hours of battery life - Camera has slow autofocus (after you use the iPhone 6 Plus, you notice slow autofocus much more) - Camera doesn\\'t have optical image stabilization (WHY???!?!?!?!?1?ONE!?) - There\\'s a slight delay between when the Turbo hears your hands-free voice command and when it performas the action - Volumes button are a tad flush to the body and takes a wee bit more effort to local them - Only one speaker - Phone can get warm to the touch - No available option for a larger screen that includes Moto Apps and the dedicated natural language chip - No SD Card slot - No fitness tracking related sensors - Mobile hotspot didn\\'t work for a couple days after launch but it works now. - Simultaneous voice and data doesn\\'t work at the time of this writing but should be added in a month or so. ✔ OTHER - The Turbo was incorrectly reporting my location initially. It was saying I was in Washington, DC when I was actually in Virginia. I changed a setting (I don\\'t remember which) and now it\\'s fixed. - I like the nylon cover, although I suspect some people might not - It has dedicated capacitive buttons, not on screen buttons. I prefer dedicated buttons, but I wish the home button was a physical button, like on the Note 4. - The phone is water resistant, (NOT WATERPROOF!). - It\\'s only available on Verizon (for now). We\\'ll have to see if the rumored Droid Maxx and Moto X Play have the same specs and features. - Some users complain about call volume. I haven\\'t experienced this issue. ✔ USING THE DROID TURBO Here are some of the things I\\'ve done with the Turbo and why I think it\\'s cool: - I can initiate a voice search without touching the Turbo. Yes, you can do this with many Android phones but on the Turbo, you can customize the command. For example, my launch phrase is \"Eagle One, come in!\" Since the Turbo has a dedicated, low power natural language processing chip, the launch command works more reliably on the Turbo that any other non-Motorola phone. Since the Turbo has a huge battery, you can leave this feature on and still get over a day of battery life. - Turbo knows when I am home. If I\\'m home when a call comes in, Turbo will say the name of the caller and ask me if I want to take the call. If I say \"listen\", Turbo will answer the call on speaker phone. If I say \"ignore\", Turbo will end the call. If the ignored caller has a mobile number in my contact list, Turbo will ask if I want to send the caller a text message. I can then speak my message to Turbo and Turbo will send it. I can do all of this without touching the Turbo. - Turbo will also announce incoming text messages when I\\'m home. I can listen to and reply to text messages without touching Turbo. - Turbo knows when I\\'m driving (or on a bus or train) and will also announce incoming text messages when I\\'m on the move. - A few times in the past couple of weeks I have taken calls from bed without getting out of bed. The Turbo can hear commands from across a room. - I\\'ve taken calls from the Turbo while sitting down, with the phone in my pocket. - I\\'ve participated in long text message threads with people while cooking dinner, all without touching my Turbo. The dedicated natural language processing chip rarely misunderstands what I am saying. - Need to take a quick photo? Twist your wrist twice while holding the Turbo to launch the camera app. You don\\'t even have to unlock your phone. - Hate having to unlock your phone all the time? Feeling envious of Apple\\'s fast and accurate Touch ID? Use Trusted Devices on the Turbo. With this functionality, you can keep your Turbo unlocked whenever it\\'s connected to a trusted Bluetooth device you designate. This can be a BT headset, your car, or even your BT equipped home computer. I use my Microsoft Band as my trusted device. Yes, using Trusted Devices is a bit risky as someone can access your phone if your trusted device is nearby. - The big battery allows me to no longer do anything to preserve battery life. No more battery saving apps, no more turning apps off, no more turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Just leave everything on, bro. And since the Turbo has wireless charging built-in, if buy a couple of $20 wireless charging pads for the home, the car, and the office, your Turbo will never run out of power. ✔ DROID TURBO vs SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4 The Note 4 has a better camera that includes OIS, a larger screen, and stylus pen support (a great advantage if you actually learn to use the pen). The Turbo has a turbo charger, built-in wireless charging, and a larger battery. The Turbo also has Moto Apps. I think more people will use the Moto Apps than they will use the Note 4 stylus pen. ✔ DROID TURBO vs IPHONE 6 PLUS The iPhone 6 Plus has the best total camera experience on any smartphone, plus a larger screen. The 6 Plus also has the best ecosystem (apps, accessories, iTunes, enterprise support, desktop integration, mind share, etc.). Unless you are heavily invested in iTunes purchases or need the best smartphone camera, I think you should switch platforms. Moto Apps are just that good. Plus the 6 Plus lacks the big battery, turbo charging, and wireless charging. ✔ DROID TURBO vs GOOGLE NEXUS 6 The Nexus 6 ships with Android 5.0 and can expect to get Android OS updates the quickest. The N6 has a larger screen and dual speakers. Its camera features a ring flash, OIS, and HDR+. If Motorola\\'s past performance is an indicator, the Turbo can expected to get Android updates pretty quick, nerfing one of the N6\\'s big advantages. Since Motorola makes both the N6 and the Turbo, I don\\'t anticipate the Turbo will get updates much later than the N6. If the N6 had Moto Apps, the dedicated voice chip, and a bigger battery, I would get the N6. The N6 doesn\\'t have these things so, to me, it loses to the Turbo. ✔ BOTTOM LINE The Droid Turbo is the best phone available. Period. It has a great screen, blistering performance, and the best battery life. Its suite of Moto Apps destroys everything running on any other phone. While it\\'s true that its camera is not as good as the Big 3 (Note 4, Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus), the camera isn\\'t bad. It\\'s actually pretty good, just not as good as the Big 3 cameras. I know I\\'m not crazy in writing this review. Several tech journalist have already suggested that the Moto X is the best Android phone available. Google \"moto x best phone ever\" and see for yourself. The Droid Turbo is a Moto X with a bigger battery, better camera, faster CPU, better screen, and more RAM. Thus, The Turbo is better than the \"best Android phone ever\". ;-) Rarely have I enjoyed using a phone so much that I would recommend people to switch platforms and even switch carriers to get the phone! The Turbo is that good. While other flagship phones provide largely the same user experience, the Turbo gives you a whole lot more. Of course, if you don\\'t think you will make great use of the Moto Apps and the big battery, or if you need a bigger screen, you can\\'t go wrong with the Note 4, Nexus 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. At the end of the day, these are all great phones. Tech Ranker . net'}\n",

There won\\'t be an iPhone 6 Plus type \"Bend-Gate\" for the Turbo. ✔ CONS: - You won\\'t get the advertised 48 hours of battery life - Camera has slow autofocus (after you use the iPhone 6 Plus, you notice slow autofocus much more) - Camera doesn\\'t have optical image stabilization (WHY???!?!?!?!?1?ONE!?) - There\\'s a slight delay between when the Turbo hears your hands-free voice command and when it performas the action - Volumes button are a tad flush to the body and takes a wee bit more effort to local them - Only one speaker - Phone can get warm to the touch - No available option for a larger screen that includes Moto Apps and the dedicated natural language chip - No SD Card slot - No fitness tracking related sensors - Mobile hotspot didn\\'t work for a couple days after launch but it works now. - Simultaneous voice and data doesn\\'t work at the time of this writing but should be added in a month or so. ✔ OTHER - The Turbo was incorrectly reporting my location initially. It was saying I was in Washington, DC when I was actually in Virginia. I changed a setting (I don\\'t remember which) and now it\\'s fixed. - I like the nylon cover, although I suspect some people might not - It has dedicated capacitive buttons, not on screen buttons. I prefer dedicated buttons, but I wish the home button was a physical button, like on the Note 4. - The phone is water resistant, (NOT WATERPROOF!). - It\\'s only available on Verizon (for now). We\\'ll have to see if the rumored Droid Maxx and Moto X Play have the same specs and features. - Some users complain about call volume. I haven\\'t experienced this issue. ✔ USING THE DROID TURBO Here are some of the things I\\'ve done with the Turbo and why I think it\\'s cool: - I can initiate a voice search without touching the Turbo. Yes, you can do this with many Android phones but on the Turbo, you can customize the command. For example, my launch phrase is \"Eagle One, come in!\" Since the Turbo has a dedicated, low power natural language processing chip, the launch command works more reliably on the Turbo that any other non-Motorola phone. Since the Turbo has a huge battery, you can leave this feature on and still get over a day of battery life. - Turbo knows when I am home. If I\\'m home when a call comes in, Turbo will say the name of the caller and ask me if I want to take the call. If I say \"listen\", Turbo will answer the call on speaker phone. If I say \"ignore\", Turbo will end the call. If the ignored caller has a mobile number in my contact list, Turbo will ask if I want to send the caller a text message. I can then speak my message to Turbo and Turbo will send it. I can do all of this without touching the Turbo. - Turbo will also announce incoming text messages when I\\'m home. I can listen to and reply to text messages without touching Turbo. - Turbo knows when I\\'m driving (or on a bus or train) and will also announce incoming text messages when I\\'m on the move. - A few times in the past couple of weeks I have taken calls from bed without getting out of bed. The Turbo can hear commands from across a room. - I\\'ve taken calls from the Turbo while sitting down, with the phone in my pocket. - I\\'ve participated in long text message threads with people while cooking dinner, all without touching my Turbo. The dedicated natural language processing chip rarely misunderstands what I am saying. - Need to take a quick photo? Twist your wrist twice while holding the Turbo to launch the camera app. You don\\'t even have to unlock your phone. - Hate having to unlock your phone all the time? Feeling envious of Apple\\'s fast and accurate Touch ID? Use Trusted Devices on the Turbo. With this functionality, you can keep your Turbo unlocked whenever it\\'s connected to a trusted Bluetooth device you designate. This can be a BT headset, your car, or even your BT equipped home computer. I use my Microsoft Band as my trusted device. Yes, using Trusted Devices is a bit risky as someone can access your phone if your trusted device is nearby. - The big battery allows me to no longer do anything to preserve battery life. No more battery saving apps, no more turning apps off, no more turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Just leave everything on, bro. And since the Turbo has wireless charging built-in, if buy a couple of $20 wireless charging pads for the home, the car, and the office, your Turbo will never run out of power. ✔ DROID TURBO vs SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4 The Note 4 has a better camera that includes OIS, a larger screen, and stylus pen support (a great advantage if you actually learn to use the pen). The Turbo has a turbo charger, built-in wireless charging, and a larger battery. The Turbo also has Moto Apps. I think more people will use the Moto Apps than they will use the Note 4 stylus pen. ✔ DROID TURBO vs IPHONE 6 PLUS The iPhone 6 Plus has the best total camera experience on any smartphone, plus a larger screen. The 6 Plus also has the best ecosystem (apps, accessories, iTunes, enterprise support, desktop integration, mind share, etc.). Unless you are heavily invested in iTunes purchases or need the best smartphone camera, I think you should switch platforms. Moto Apps are just that good. Plus the 6 Plus lacks the big battery, turbo charging, and wireless charging. ✔ DROID TURBO vs GOOGLE NEXUS 6 The Nexus 6 ships with Android 5.0 and can expect to get Android OS updates the quickest. The N6 has a larger screen and dual speakers. Its camera features a ring flash, OIS, and HDR+. If Motorola\\'s past performance is an indicator, the Turbo can expected to get Android updates pretty quick, nerfing one of the N6\\'s big advantages. Since Motorola makes both the N6 and the Turbo, I don\\'t anticipate the Turbo will get updates much later than the N6. If the N6 had Moto Apps, the dedicated voice chip, and a bigger battery, I would get the N6. The N6 doesn\\'t have these things so, to me, it loses to the Turbo. ✔ BOTTOM LINE The Droid Turbo is the best phone available. Period. It has a great screen, blistering performance, and the best battery life. Its suite of Moto Apps destroys everything running on any other phone. While it\\'s true that its camera is not as good as the Big 3 (Note 4, Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus), the camera isn\\'t bad. It\\'s actually pretty good, just not as good as the Big 3 cameras. I know I\\'m not crazy in writing this review. Several tech journalist have already suggested that the Moto X is the best Android phone available. Google \"moto x best phone ever\" and see for yourself. The Droid Turbo is a Moto X with a bigger battery, better camera, faster CPU, better screen, and more RAM. Thus, The Turbo is better than the \"best Android phone ever\". ;-) Rarely have I enjoyed using a phone so much that I would recommend people to switch platforms and even switch carriers to get the phone! The Turbo is that good. While other flagship phones provide largely the same user experience, the Turbo gives you a whole lot more. Of course, if you don\\'t think you will make great use of the Moto Apps and the big battery, or if you need a bigger screen, you can\\'t go wrong with the Note 4, Nexus 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. At the end of the day, these are all great phones. Tech Ranker . net'}\n",

      "{'Ranking': 0.5004659832246039, 'Review_ID': 'review_18457', 'review_body': 'I owned the original Samsung Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note 2. I skipped the Note 3 mostly because I didn\\'t have any available upgrades on my family plan ;-). Plus I figured I\\'d skip a generation and get a much better Note. I purchased the Note 4, thought it was great, and then promptly returned it. \"Why\", do you ask? The answer is simple... ================================================= THE DROID TURBO IS THE BEST PHONE KNOWN TO MAN! ================================================= Before you kill me for saying this, hear me out. I\\'m not a fan boy. I don\\'t work for Motorola. I\\'ve tried a number of the current flagship phones before deciding on the Turbo. Here are some of my thoughts on the other phones: - I tried the Note 4, thought it was great, and returned it. - I have the iPhone 6 Plus, loved it, planned to keep it, tried the Turbo, and now I\\'m looking to sell the 6 Plus. - I also owned the HTC ONE M8 for Windows, thought it was cool, was pleasantly surprised when it started reading text messages to me automatically while I was driving, but I returned it as I was worried about the ecosystem. - I briefly got my hands on the Nexus 6. Thought it was great. Was happy to see that it was made by Motorola, and was then quickly disappointed that it was missing the Motorola Apps and features found on the Moto X and Droid Turbo. In my opinion, the combination of great specs, a great screen, blistering performance, slap your momma long battery life, and most importantly, the unique suite of Moto Apps firmly places the Droid Turbo ahead of all other smartphones. ✔ PROS: - Very nice screen - Fast Performance - Good (not great) camera - Double twist your wrist to launch the camera - The mother of all batteries (MOAB) - Trusted Devices: Keep your phone unlocked when it\\'s near a trusted device (headset, fitness band, etc.) - Moto Voice: The Turbo is always listening for your commands, allowing you to use your phone without touching it - Moto Assist: The Turbo knows when you are home and allows you to accept/reject phone calls via verbal commands. When you are home or when you are driving, the Turbo allows you to hear and respond to text messages via verbal commands. The Turbo will also silence your phone during meetings - Moto Actions: Sensors detect hand gestures to let you activate your phone\\'s screen without touching it. You can use this to see the current time, preview notifications, or wave off incoming calls - Moto Display: See notifications on your phone without touching the phone. You can preview and act on notification from the lock screen - Customizable \"Hello Google\", hands free voice command phrase. - Accurate voice recognition courtesy of an included secondary chip dedicated to natural language processing - Qi wireless charging support. Just buy a $20 wireless charger and you\\'re set. - Turbo Charger support (get 8 hours of charge in only 15 minutes) - Very close to stock Android 4.4.
